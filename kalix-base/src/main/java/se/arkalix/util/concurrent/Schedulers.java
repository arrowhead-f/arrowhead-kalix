/**
 * Kalix default schedulers.
 * <p>
 * These schedulers are used by default by all parts of the Kalix library that
 * need scheduling capabilities to operate. They are started up automatically
 * when this class is loaded for the first time, and are shut down
 * automatically when the application is terminated via an OS interrupt signal
 * or by calling {@link System#exit(int)}.
 * <p>
 * Two default schedulers are provided, a <i>fixed</i> and a <i>dynamic</i>.
 * The former is fixed in the sense that it contains a fixed number of pooled
 * threads, chosen to make optimal use of the number of available system CPUs,
 * while the latter is dynamic in the sense that it will contain as many
 * threads as are necessary to prevent pending jobs from having to wait before
 * being executed.
 * <p>
 * Use of the fixed scheduler is preferred for all operations that are
 * <i>non-blocking</i>, which means that they will never suspend the current
 * thread for significant amounts of time (such as for longer than 0.1ms). The
 * reason for the fixed scheduler being preferred is that it makes better use
 * of available CPU resources by switching less between threads, which is a
 * relatively costly operation. As, however, not all operations can be
 * designated as non-blocking, such as old Java I/O calls, JDBC calls,
 * long-running computations, and so on, the dynamic scheduler exists as an
 * alternative. If not used frequently enough, the dynamic scheduler will not
 * contain any cached threads at all, which avoids the costs incurred by
 * context-switching.
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, as a way to minimize synchronization between threads, the fixed
 * size scheduler guarantees that if a job is scheduled by one of its pooled
 * threads, the job will be executed by the thread that scheduled it.
