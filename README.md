# The Arrowhead Kalix Libraries

`ar:kalix` is a set of Java libraries designed to simplify the creation of
Arrowhead Framework compliant industrial IoT systems. The libraries provide a
platform for modern asynchronous I/O, utilities for seamless message
codecType/decoding, robust abstractions for creating and communicating with
Arrowhead-compliant systems, as well as a plugin-system that makes it
convenient to reuse service integrations.

Please refer to [arkalix.se](https://arkalix.se) for more information about the
Arrowhead Kalix library and the Arrowhead Framework.
